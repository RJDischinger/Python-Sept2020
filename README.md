# World Facts Quiz Python-Sept2020
repository for codeLouisville Python Sept 2020 project

1. Clone the repository to your machine: 
2. Run the "WorldStatsQuestions" in the python terminal:
    This will import the information needed to run the Quiz.
3. Follow the on screen instructions from the "Main Menu"
4. You can choose the "Help" screen by typing "h" from the "Main Menu"
5. The tests.py must be called manually. (It is not set up to run from the "WorldStatsQuestions")

The requirements attempted include:
  Implement a "master loop" console...
    This is presented as a "Main Menu".
  #NOT COMPLETED TO DATE: Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data.
  #NOT COMPLETED TO DATE: Implement a log that records errors ... and writes to a text file.
     This has been started with a simple question input that logs to a text file that I want to develop further.
  Create and call at least 3 functions.
    This has been completed.
  #NOT COMPLETED TO DATE: I attempted using regex, but ultimately had to delete this portion for now.
  #NOT COMPLETED TO DATE: Create 3 or more unit tests for your application.
    This has been written, but the tests do not currently test anything of value, so I intend to clean this up and make it of value.
  Build a conversion tool ...
    This is completed with a simple code to convert "miles" to "kilometers" and "pounds" to "kilograms"
  Calculate and display data based on an external factor ...
    This is completed during the "Christmas Greeting" using datetime.
  #NOT COMPLETED TO DATE: I hope to add ... Analyse text and display information...
